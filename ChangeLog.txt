week 1 : Starting reading and documentating on the Required Knowledge
(16/05/22 -- 22/05/22)
		-- getting information on how to use intel documentation.

		-- getting basic information on how a CPU work.

		-- getting basic information on x86 assembly.

		-- starting tutoriel on how to use objdump.

		-- starting Bran's tutoriel for kernel coding.

week 2 :  Kernel base code session, Understanding basic architecture .
(22/05/22 -- 29/05/22)
		-- finished coding main.c start.s scrn.c link.ld.

		-- figuring out why grub don't load the kernel ("got multiboot header
		missing").

		-- found that multiboot header constants (magic, flags, checksum)
		were not properly initialized in start.s, and starti.s had wrong
		extension (.asm instead of .s).

		-- Having a "Hello Kernel World !" printed and working, i will now
		rework on the understanding of the actual architecture. (why theses
		work and how they work together)
